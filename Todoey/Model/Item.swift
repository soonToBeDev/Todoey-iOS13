    var parentCategory = LinkingObjects(fromType: Category.self, property: "items")
    // parentCategory is the inverse relatinship that links each Item back to a parent Category for example if we have a Category called Home and inside that category we have an Item called stove, Home is the parent category of stove and in order to assign stove as its "child" we have to use LinkingObjects, with a type of "Category.self" to relate the Home Category and that stove to each other, and we give it a property name of the inverse relationship which is "items" -> ( let items = List<Item>() from Item.swift )
